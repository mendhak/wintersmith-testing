It all comes down to your hardware, settings and environment. The *accuracy* is only as good as your phone's GPS chip. Some phones may have 4 meter accuracies, some have 500 meters. Also, using GPS satellites will give you better accuracy but take a longer time; using network location will give worse accuracy but is quicker. You may also want to check your environment, as there can be inaccuracy due to clouds, buildings, sunspots, alien invasion, etc.

Images possible?

Do you think `code` would work too?  I sure hope that kind of `stuff works too!`

    var x = 9;
    console.log(x);
    x++;

Or perhaps with quotes...

>`setidentifier` - a form of setting the identifier  
`inconclusive` - when it's inconclusive




Yes I thinkimages are possible.

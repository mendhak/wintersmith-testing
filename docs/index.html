        <p class="description">A battery efficient GPS logging application</p>
        <section class="blurb">GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your Android phone to log coordinates to GPS format files at regular intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to geotag your photos after a day out or share your travel route with someone. The purpose of this application is to be battery efficient to save you battery power when abroad and last as long as possible.</section><a class="button">Tour</a> <a class="button">FAQ</a> <a class="button">Screenshots</a> <a href="https://paypal.me/mendhak/" class="pull-right"><img src="images/Paypal-Donate-Button-Image.png" height="55px" class="pull-right"> </a><a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/" class="pull-right"><img src="images/social/GitHub_Logo.png" height="40px" class="pull-right"> <img src="images/social/GitHub-Mark-64px.png" height="40px" class="pull-right"></a><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger" class="pull-right"><img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge-border.png" height="50px" class="pull-right"> </a>

<h2 id="why-is-it-taking-so-long-to-find-a-fix-">Why is it taking so long to find a&nbsp;fix?</h2>
<p>There can be several reasons reasons for&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>New location</strong> - if you are at a new location after a long flight, the <span class="caps">GPS</span> on your phone can take a while to reorient itself. Try running GPSLogger at high frequency until it does find a&nbsp;location.</p>
<p><strong>Interference</strong> - there may be structures nearby blocking your&nbsp;signal.</p>
<p><strong>Mid flight</strong> - if you are in a commercial aircraft, you are probably traveling too fast for your phone’s hardware to keep up with the <span class="caps">GPS</span>&nbsp;signals.</p>

<h2 id="sometimes-the-app-will-not-log-for-long-periods-of-time">Sometimes, the app will not log for long periods of&nbsp;time</h2>
<p>Sometimes your specified time interval will have passed, but no point was logged.  There are a few reasons this could&nbsp;happens. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <span class="caps">GPS</span> system will have attempted to find its location and given up after a while. This in turn means that Android OS will not have given a location to&nbsp;GPSLogger</p>
</li>
<li><p>The accuracy was below your <em>Accuracy filter</em> settings, or the distance was below your <em>Distance filter</em> settings, so GPSLogger didn’t log it. You can try setting a <em>retry interval</em> in which GPSLogger can wait for a more accurate point to show up and then use it.  Or you can allow for slightly more inaccurate fixes - your mileage may vary as every phone is different in terms of how accurate a fix it can get on a regular&nbsp;basis. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally, on Android 6+ (Marshmallow), a new feature called <em><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html">doze mode</a></em> was introduced, which severely restricts activity on the device after certain periods of inactivity. You can choose to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/stop-specific-apps-from-using-doze-on-android-6-0-marshmallow/">whitelist GPSLogger</a> which does not bypass doze mode but occasionally provides logging windows in which to work. It will not make a great difference though, doze mode is quite&nbsp;aggressive.</p>

          <div class="lead"><h2 id="why-are-the-fixes-sometimes-inaccurate-">Why are the fixes sometimes&nbsp;inaccurate?</h2>
<p>It all comes down to your hardware, settings and environment. The accuracy is only as good as your phone’s <span class="caps">GPS</span> chip. Some phones may have 4 meter accuracies, some have 500 meters. Also, using GPS satellites will give you better accuracy but take a longer time; using network location will give worse accuracy but is quicker. You may also want to check your environment, as there can be inaccuracy due to clouds, buildings, sunspots, alien invasion,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>The standard when logging points is to use <span class="caps">UTC</span>. Since this is the standard, it would be wrong to use the the local time zone, the file is considered invalid. Instead, it is the responsibility of the software you use the log file on (Google Earth, GeoSetter, etc.) to adjust for your timezone. Any application that deals with GPX or KML files will have a setting that allows you to specify your own&nbsp;timezone.</p>

<p>If the app is logging, and you make changes to the settings, the changes will take effect <em>after</em> the next point is logged. This means that if you’ve set your interval as 1 hour, you have a long wait ahead of you. If you want the changes to take effect immediately, then stop logging and start it again so that the changes are&nbsp;refreshed.</p>

<p>Example: <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial part will be different for your&nbsp;device. </p>
<p>If you have a file explorer installed, you can click on the folder paths in the simple/detailed&nbsp;screens.</p>
<p>To copy the GPSLogger files, you can connect your phone to your computer and mount the <span class="caps">SD</span> card, then copy straight from the above folder. You can also change the default folder in the app&nbsp;settings. </p>
<p>Finally, note that due to the <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/09/storage-situation-removable-storage.html">restrictions introduced in Android KitKat</a>, any files in the default folder will be removed if you uninstall the&nbsp;app.</p>

<p>Mainly, turn wifi off, turn mobile data off, turn background synchronization off, turn bluetooth&nbsp;off. </p>
<p>If you turn mobile data off, you’ll probably want to inject aGPS data regularly, there are apps that can do it for you. You can also try going into airplane mode which turns many things&nbsp;off. </p>
<p>When it comes to choosing between <em>location sources</em> - <span class="caps">GPS</span> vs network - GPS will be more battery hungry, but has better accuracy; network location is easier on the battery but isn’t as&nbsp;accurate.</p>
<p>For <em>time intervals</em>, consider using 60 seconds or&nbsp;more.</p>

<p><strong>Time before logging</strong> - How long to wait after a point has been logged to try logging&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Distance filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this much distance exists between the previous and current points. If it isn’t this distance, the point is&nbsp;discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this point has a minimum accuracy specified. If it does not match the specified accuracy, the point is discarded. This is useful if you are inside a building for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p><strong>Time interval for accuracy</strong> - When searching for a point, the app can continue searching for this many seconds until it finds a point that meets the accuracy and distance filter criteria&nbsp;above.</p>

<p>It’s how the Android <span class="caps">OS</span> has implemented its GPS system. When you say you want a point every 60 seconds (for example), that’s actually a suggestion rather than an imperative, and so the time interval between GPS points is never guaranteed. GPSLogger has logic that checks the time difference, though, and will make sure that at least 60 seconds have passed before logging again.  It is not meant for sub-second logging, as that will require aggressive&nbsp;wakelocks.</p>

<p>As of newer versions of Android, removing the notification will cause the service to be killed. As a result, the notification now needs to stay there. You may have seen a recent increase in the number of apps that need to sit in the notification bar for the same reason - to perform background services without being&nbsp;killed.  </p>
<p>There is an option in the app’s settings that allows you to remove the notification buttons if you want a smaller&nbsp;notification.  </p>

<p>If your automation app can send intents, you can use those intents to control GPSLogger and get it to perform a few actions. 
For example, in Tasker, create a new action under Misc &gt; Send&nbsp;Intent. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action: <code>com.mendhak.gpslogger.GpsLoggingService</code><br>Extra: <code>immediatestart:true (others below)</code><br>Target: <code>Service</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the extras you can send to&nbsp;GPSLogger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>immediatestart</code> - (true/false) Start logging&nbsp;immediately  </p>
<p><code>immediatestop</code> - (true/false) Stop&nbsp;logging</p>
<p><code>logonce</code> - (true/false) Log a single point and&nbsp;stop</p>
<p><code>setnextpointdescription</code> - (text) Sets the annotation text to use for the next point&nbsp;logged</p>
<p><code>settimebeforelogging</code> - (number) Sets preference for time before logging&nbsp;option  </p>
<p><code>setdistancebeforelogging</code> - (number) Sets preference for distance before logging&nbsp;option</p>
<p><code>setkeepbetweenfix</code> - (true/false) Sets preference whether to keep <span class="caps">GPS</span> on between&nbsp;fixes</p>
<p><code>setretrytime</code> - (number) Sets preference for retry&nbsp;time</p>
<p><code>setabsolutetimeout</code> - (number) Sets preference for absolute&nbsp;timeout</p>
<p><code>setprefercelltower</code> - (true/false) Enables or disables the <span class="caps">GPS</span> or celltower&nbsp;listeners</p>

<p>You can also invoke the Start and Stop <strong>shortcuts</strong> that GPSLogger comes&nbsp;with.</p>

<p>Task managers don’t like GPSLogger and will <em>frequently</em> kill the&nbsp;service.  </p>
<p>Due to the varied nature of the way task managers and task killers work, I simply cannot help or advise with any problems where you have one of these installed, and <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/166140/you-dont-need-to-install-a-task-manager-how-to-manage-running-apps-on-android/">would advise against it as&nbsp;well</a></p>

<p>Many people actually distribute GPSLogger to colleagues preinstalled on phones, with some preset&nbsp;values. </p>
<p>If you create a file in the default folder or at <code>/sdcard/gpslogger.properties</code>, then GPSLogger will read this file each time it loads and apply those settings to the&nbsp;application. </p>
<p>For example, in the file you can put <code>accuracy_before_logging=42</code> and that will reset the <em>Accuracy Filter</em> to 42 meters each time the application starts. There are many properties that can be applied and you can glean a <a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/blob/master/gpslogger/src/main/java/com/mendhak/gpslogger/common/PreferenceNames.java">full list here</a>.</p>
<p>The most common examples of properties would be <code>log_gpx</code>, <code>log_kml</code>, <code>time_before_logging</code>, <code>opengts_*</code> for OpenGTS settings, <code>smtp_*</code> for email&nbsp;settings.</p>

<p>It’s meant to be more battery efficient. A lot of other apps, such as MyTracks, usually go with the assumption that you have a data connection available and your routes won’t be very long. They use <span class="caps">CPU</span> wakelocks and log points extremely frequently with high accuracy. The aim of GPSLogger is to log points and stay&nbsp;quiet.  </p>
<p>To put it another way, MyTracks or similar are better suited for runs; GPSLogger is suited for days out, hiking,&nbsp;photography.</p>

          <p class="description">A battery efficient GPS logging application for Android</p>
          <section class="blurb">GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your Android phone to log coordinates to GPS format files at regular intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to geotag your photos after a day out or share your travel route with someone. The purpose of this application is to be battery efficient to save you battery power when abroad and last as long as possible.</section><a class="button">Tour</a> <a class="button">FAQ</a> <a class="button">Screenshots</a>

<p>It all comes down to your hardware, settings and environment. The <em>accuracy</em> is only as good as your phone’s <span class="caps">GPS</span> chip. Some phones may have 4 meter accuracies, some have 500 meters. Also, using GPS satellites will give you better accuracy but take a longer time; using network location will give worse accuracy but is quicker. You may also want to check your environment, as there can be inaccuracy due to clouds, buildings, sunspots, alien invasion,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Images possible?

<p>Do you think code would work&nbsp;too?</p>
<pre><code>var x = 9;
console.log(x);
x++;
</code></pre><p>Or perhaps with&nbsp;quotes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>setidentifier</code> - a form of setting the identifier<br><code>inconclusive</code> - when it’s&nbsp;inconclusive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I thinkimages are&nbsp;possible.</p>

<p>A long time ago, when the world was young – someone put some food on their tongue.
They tasted the food, and thought it was nice. Most fruit liked it – but banana’s thought&nbsp;twice.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p><img src="images/banana.png" alt="a banana"></p>
<p>They held a meeting at quarter past eight.
Whilst the human’s were getting home late.
They decided they didn’t want to be eaten they said:
“No way, we’re not going to be&nbsp;beaten”.</p>
<p>So time went by, and human’s got old.
Banana’s got ready, for their prophets had told.
That soon shall come the dawn of war.
Where humans will rule the earth no&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The humans knew not of the evil banana’s plans.
They made their cars, guitars and aluminum cans.
And the banana’s began to take over the east.
While humans knew not, and kept having their&nbsp;feast.</p>
<p>But time has run out, no more hiding there can be.
Or else the banana’s will kill you and me.
We must take up arms, and fight to the end.
Because, believe it or not, a banana is not a&nbsp;friend.</p>
